# Illusion.ObjectMap

I like the Koikatsu Sunshine maps a lot, but sometimes I wanna customize them to my needs for specific scenes or events. This mod was made with the intent of allowing you to edit maps, within reason.

This plugin allows you to:
- Move individual objects
- Enable/Disable individual objects
- Manipulate map lights (Highly recommend getting [LightSettings](https://github.com/starstormhun/StarPlugins))
- Use MaterialEditor on map objects

What it doesn't let you do:
- Delete map objects
- Reparent map objects
- Parent stuff TO map objects
- Copy map objects
- Make her come back... :(

Known Issues:
- If your map is particularly large with many individual items, this plugin may slow down loading *considerably* as it works through all of them. So you may have to sit around a while longer, sorry.
